# 🧦 SoleMate.cloud - 60 Second Pitch

## **"Find Your Sole Mate"** - AI-Powered Sock Dating

### 🌐 Live at: **https://solemate.cloud**

## THE PITCH (60 seconds)

**[0-10 sec] THE HOOK**
> "We built **SoleMate** - a dating app for socks. Because `sock.color === sock.color` was just too simple."

**[10-25 sec] THE PROBLEM**
> "Every year, millions of socks lose their partners in the laundry. Traditional matching? One line of code. But we asked: what if sock matching deserved *enterprise architecture*?"

**[25-45 sec] THE SOLUTION - Show Architecture**
> "So we assembled a **committee of 5 AI agents** powered by **Bedrock Claude 3**:
> - Dr. Chromatius analyzes color psychology
> - Prof. Sockmund Freud determines the sock's MBTI type  
> - Justice Sockrates renders the final philosophical verdict
>
> All orchestrated by **Step Functions**, broadcasting **20+ events** through **EventBridge**, with **real-time WebSocket updates**."

**[45-55 sec] THE NUMBERS**
> "The result? **$0.15 per match** instead of $0.000001. **30 seconds** instead of milliseconds. **17 AWS services** to do what one if-statement could do."

**[55-60 sec] THE CLOSER**
> "We're **150 million times more expensive** than necessary. Check it out at **solemate.cloud**."
