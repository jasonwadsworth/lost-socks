# 🧦 SoleMate - The 60-Second Pitch

---

Every year, 1.3 billion socks go missing in laundry rooms worldwide. That's not a statistic. That's a *crisis*.

So we built **SoleMate** — a globally distributed, AI-powered sock matching platform. Because apparently, `sock.color === sock.color` wasn't *enterprise-grade enough*.

Here's how it works: You upload a photo of your lonely sock. Amazon Rekognition analyzes its RGB values, texture patterns, and emotional state. Then we summon a **committee of five AI agents** — yes, five — powered by Bedrock Claude 3.

Meet the team: Dr. Chromatius, PhD in Chromatics. Professor Sockmund Freud, sock psychologist. And Justice Sockrates, who renders philosophical verdicts on textile compatibility.

They deliberate. In real-time. For 30 seconds. Using Step Functions to orchestrate parallel agent execution, EventBridge to publish 20 events per sock, and API Gateway WebSockets so you can watch them think.

We store sock metadata in DynamoDB with global replication — because your sock's MBTI type needs multi-region durability. When a match is found, SNS sends you a "sock reunion notification."

The result? **17 AWS services**. **$0.15 per match**. **150 million times more expensive** than an if-statement.

Look at that — Dr. Chromatius is analyzing chromatic harmony. Prof. Freud just assigned it a zodiac sign. Justice Sockrates is... consulting Kantian ethics.

Verdict: "FULLY MATCHABLE."

We built the most sophisticated sock matching system ever created. It's slower, more expensive, and infinitely more ridiculous than necessary.
